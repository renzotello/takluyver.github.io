<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Simon">IBM Simon</a>, released in 1994,
has been called the first smartphone. But it was the launch of the iPhone in
2007 that brought touchscreen, pocket sized computers to the mass market. Today,
over <a class="reference external" href="https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/press-releases/articles/smartphone-ownership-peaks.html">three quarters of adults</a>
in the UK own a smartphone. We keep our phones on 24/7, tiny computers running
full operating systems, with microphones, cameras, GPS and accelerometers.
The possibilities if we control them ourselves are amazing,
and the possibilities if someone else gets control are terrifying.
So we've got good reasons to want a phone running software that we can inspect
and change.</p>
<p>This post, based on a talk I did for <a class="reference external" href="http://portsmouth.lug.org.uk/">Portsmouth Linux User Group</a>, looks at the landscape of free and open
source software (FOSS) available for phones in late 2017.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-big-two">
<h2>The big two</h2>
<p>Before we get into the FOSS alternatives, how open are the two platforms that
make up the vast majority of the smartphone market today?</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="/images/android_ios_openness.png" src="../images/android_ios_openness.png"><p class="caption">Open parts in green, proprietary parts in red.</p>
</div>
<p>Both Android and iOS have some open-source parts. But they require
proprietary drivers and firmware to run on most phones. The freedom to modify
the software and run your modified version is not readily available to end users.
Google's <a class="reference external" href="https://arstechnica.co.uk/gadgets/2017/05/google-android-updates-project-treble/">Project Treble</a>,
which aims to make updating Android easier, <em>might</em> make it more feasible to
run modified versions of Android.</p>
<p>Developers can build apps on the <a class="reference external" href="https://source.android.com/">open source Android platform</a>, but many apps also rely on proprietary
Google APIs.</p>
<p>With an option in the security settings, Android allows 'sideloading' apps from
sources other than the Google Play store. This possibility allows
<a class="reference external" href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a> to exist: an app store solely for FOSS
applications. If you've got an Android device, give F-Droid a try: it's an easy,
low risk step into the mobile open source world.
Its catalogue of ~1400 applications is tiny compared to the millions in Google
Play, but you might discover something interesting.</p>
<p>Now, what other options are there besides the big two?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="commercial-offerings">
<h2>Commercial offerings</h2>
<p>First, what other platforms can you (or could you) buy a phone with?</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p><strong>Firefox OS</strong> was launched in 2011, with a goal of running on inexpensive
low-end smartphones, for people in developing countries who may not have a
smartphone already. It relied heavily on browser technologies—HTML, CSS and
Javascript—for both applications and the system UI. That's no surprise for a
platform from Mozilla. A number of devices were released running Firefox OS, but
in 2016 Mozilla decided to refocus its efforts elsewhere.
A fork called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kaiostech.com/">KaiOS</a> lives on, but there's
little information available about it.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Ubuntu Touch</strong> was also launched in 2011. Spanish manufacturer <em>BQ</em> and Chinese
<em>Meizu</em> made a handful of models running Ubuntu Touch. But it's best known
for the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ubuntu-edge#/">Ubuntu Edge</a>, a
wildly ambitious crowdfunding campaign for a premium smartphone which could be
plugged into a monitor and keyboard to run a full Ubuntu desktop. Despite
thousands of eager pledges, it didn't get close to its $32 million goal, so
people got their money back and the project was cancelled. Canonical kept
promoting Ubuntu Touch until earlier this year, when they handed it over to the
<a class="reference external" href="https://ubports.com/">UBports</a> community project.</p>

<p>Next up, there's... these things:</p>

</div>
<p>Nokia used to make remarkably open 'internet tablets' based on Maemo, and then
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N9">one phone</a> using Meego, before they
went all-in on Windows Phone in 2011. We can only wonder what might have been
if they'd stuck with their Linux platform.</p>
<p>Samsung's branch of this family is now called <strong>Tizen</strong>. Samsung have used it
in several smartwatches, and a line of smartphones sold in India, such as the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.samsung.com/in/microsite/z2/">Z2</a>. I'm not sure that Samsung
is any better a guardian of a free and open platform than Google, but they might
put a small dent in Android's market dominance.</p>

<img alt="/images/Jolla_Touchstone.jpg" src="../images/Jolla_Touchstone.jpg"><p class="caption">Jolla smartphone running Sailfish OS. Image by Herman on <a class="reference external" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jolla_Touchstone.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>The other branch I want to point out is <strong>Sailfish</strong>, maintained by <em>Jolla</em>,
a company founded by ex-Nokia employees. Jolla produced a couple of devices
themselves, then turned to a licensing model. A few other companies have now
released Sailfish phones. However, Sailfish OS is not completely open source;
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/73amlm/so_how_open_is_sailfish_os_really/">this Reddit post</a>
describes which parts of the stack are open.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="diy-options">
<h2>DIY options</h2>
<p>Nothing you can buy today could really be called an open smartphone, as
far as I've found. So what can we install ourselves?</p>
<p><strong>LineageOS</strong>, formerly called CyanogenMod, is probably the most popular
alternative Android distribution. It has support for quite a lot of phones,
but far from all of them. If you've got a supported phone, installation looks
<a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/5snxtA5e2RY?t=1m15s">like this</a>—not too complex, but you'd
need quite a bit of confidence to try this on your only phone.</p>
<p>Android ROMs like Lineage are often used together with <strong>Open GApps</strong>, which
provides the proprietary Google applications that are bundled into Android
phones when you buy them. I'm not sure I'd call that 'open', but it's
undeniably useful for many people who rely on Google services.</p>
<p>One other Android distribution I'll mention is <strong>Replicant</strong>. This is a
strictly free software distribution, avoiding proprietary code as much as
possible. However, it only supports a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.replicant.us/supported-devices.php">few devices</a>, all of which appear to be
older models. F-Droid's collection of open source apps (see above) is a crucial
companion for a distribution like this.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/File:Google_Galaxy_Nexus_GSM_running_Xfce4.jpeg">PostmarketOS wiki</a>.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>PostmarketOS</strong> is a new non-Android based entrant, which aims to keep devices
running updated GNU/Linux for ten years. It can already run on <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Devices">more than 30
devices</a>, which sounds
impressive, but in most cases key features like audio and cameras are not
working yet. We have to hope that this can evolve into a useful phone platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-new-hope">
<h2>A new hope</h2>
<p>I'm writing this a few weeks after the <a class="reference external" href="https://puri.sm/shop/librem-5/">Purism Librem 5</a> crowdfunding campaign comfortably met its
$1.5 million target. Purism, a company that already sells open laptops, plans to
make a phone that's as open as possible, with hardware switches to disconnect
parts like the cellular modem, which probably has to run proprietary code.
They even say that, like the unrealised Ubuntu Edge, you will be able to plug in
peripherals and run a full Linux desktop from it. The estimated shipping date
is early in 2019.</p>
<p>The Librem 5 is currently the hot new thing in the open phone world, but there
are already <a class="reference external" href="https://nullr0ute.com/2017/10/why-im-not-backing-the-purism-librem-5-phone/">some concerns</a>
about it. At $600, it's priced like a premium device, but the proposed chips
date from either 2013 or 2011, so the experience in 2019 may be underwhelming.
And it could still require proprietary firmware for tasks like decoding video.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="key-challenges">
<h2>Key challenges</h2>
<p>The biggest challenge for any alternative mobile OS is bootstrapping an app ecosystem.
A platform with few apps struggles to attract users, and with few users
there's little incentive for developers to make apps. Catch 22.
Even Microsoft's efforts weren't enough to create a viable ecosystem around
Windows Phone.</p>
<p>There are a couple of strategies companies have tried to avoid the 'app trap':</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>HTML apps: the web is an open platform, and lots of services already have a
mobile web interface, although it's often inferior to their native mobile apps.
Despite all of the effort going into browsers, though, web applications still
tend to feel slower than native ones, and rarely work well offline.</li>
<li>Emulate Android: Sailfish does this, albeit with a proprietary component.
But if you do it well, developers won't target your platform specifically,
so it won't have much to differentiate it from Android.</li>
</ul>
<p>Open source efforts face another challenge. The Fedora image I installed on
my laptop would work on most 64-bit PCs, but with a phone OS, you have to
download an image for one specific model. This makes it much harder to casually
experiment with an alternative OS: someone needs to build it for the
exact phone you have. PostmarketOS is attempting to change this model, but it's
very early days. Meanwhile, Google's 'Project Treble' may provide a common
interface to build a platform on, although it leaves a lot of code below the
common interface under the control of vendors.</p>
